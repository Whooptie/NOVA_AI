## 🤖 What is Nova?

Nova is a **personal AI companion** that runs entirely locally on my own machine. She doesn't use an LLM (like ChatGPT), no cloud, no internet — everything happens locally, under my own rules.

Nova is built on **symbolic AI**: she learns through explicit concepts, relationships and behavioral patterns — not through a statistical language model. She runs **24/7 as a background process** and can proactively respond to patterns in my behavior.

> *"No black box. No cloud. No surprises."*

## 🏗️ Architecture

Nova is built around a central **EventBus** — a publish/subscribe system where all modules communicate with each other without direct dependencies.

```
User → IntentRouter → EventBus → Modules
                                ↕
                          Memory Brain
                     (7-layer learning architecture)
```

### 🧠 The memory — 7 layers


| Layer   | Name                                                       | Status        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Layer 0 | SQLite storage (WAL, write buffering, crash recovery)      | ✅ Done       |
| Layer 1 | Word associations learner (PMI scoring)                    | ✅ Done       |
| Layer 2 | Behavioral patterns (timing, frequency, anomaly detection) | ✅ Done       |
| Layer 3 | Semantic reasoning (concepts, relations, inference)        | ✅ Done       |
| Layer 4 | Response generator (templates, tone variation, routing)    | ✅ Done       |
| Layer 5 | Context management (interruption logic)                    | ✅ Done       |
| Layer 6 | Personality & emotion engine                               | ✅ Done       |
| Layer 7 | Emergent behavior (self-awareness)                         | ✅ Done       |

## 💻 How it works — an example

Nova learns through explicit concepts. No statistics, no guesswork.

```python
# Kevin teaches Nova a new concept
> teach: a guitar is a stringed instrument

# Nova stores this in concepts.json
{
  "guitar": {
    "senses": [{
      "definition": "a stringed instrument",
      "relations": {"is_a": ["stringed instrument"]}
    }]
  }
}

# Later, Kevin asks a question
> is a guitar an instrument?

# Nova reasons:
# guitar → is_a → stringed instrument → is_a → instrument
# Answer: "Yes, a guitar is an instrument."
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Principles

- **100% local** — no data leaves my machine
- **No LLM** — no OpenAI, no Gemini, no cloud AI
- **Never acts without consent** — Nova always suggests first
- **Fully transparent** — everything is logged and inspectable
- **Open architecture** — every concept is readable in `concepts.json`
- **ML only as a sensor** — external models may help perceive, Nova decides what to do

---

## ⚠️ About the data files in this repository

This repo contains **more than just code** — it also contains Nova's real, growing memory: files like `concepts.json`, `word_associations.json`, `patterns_layer2.json` and everything under `identity/personality/`. These are **not sample or test data** — this is Nova's accumulated knowledge and personality from real conversations with me.

This repository serves primarily as a **personal backup**, and has been made public so others can follow along with the project's development — not as a ready-to-use installable package for personal use.

---

## 🚀 On the roadmap

- 🟡 Expanding the personality pipeline to all intents
- 🟢 Layer 5: Context management (when may Nova interrupt?)
- 🟢 User preferences module (what Nova remembers about me)
- 🟢 Activity Awareness (recognizing activities & proactive responses)
- 🟢 Activity-Aware Interaction (interruption learning)
- 🟢 Intent classifier (small local ML model as a specialist)
- 🔮 Avatar / desktop companion (animated avatar, lipsync)
- 🔮 More board games (checkers, Go)
- 🔮 Smart home integration (lights, sensors)
- 🔮 Robotics integration (far future)

---

## 🛠️ Technical requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Windows (tested on Windows 11)
- Stockfish engine (for chess — download it yourself at stockfishchess.org)
- OpenWeatherMap API key (free to create at openweathermap.org)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

> Note: this project is not meant to be simply cloned and run — it's tightly coupled to my own paths, settings and personal data files.

## 👤 About this project

Nova is being built by **Kevin** — a self-taught developer from Belgium.
No prior knowledge. No programming background. Just curiosity and persistence.

This project started as an experiment and is growing into a full local AI system with a planned roadmap of 498+ modules.

> *"Most AI projects give you a black box. Nova is my attempt to understand how intelligence really works — step by step, concept by concept."*
